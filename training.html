        <p class="training-p para">Adopting a new dog is such a fun, exciting time. But it can also be
          challenging, as you’re both getting to know each other and your new life together. A common source of frustration for new dog owners is house training a puppy. If you adopted a puppy or an adult dog that’s not fully housetrained, one of the
          first things you need to teach them is how to go to the bathroom outside. Even fully housetrained dogs will need a reintroduction to the basics when moving into a new home.
          We all may hold jobs that preclude a schedule compatible with a puppy’s developmental needs, or live in housing without fenced-in yards, thus forcing us to paper-train until our pups are fully immunized. The further a lifestyle varies from
          the ideal, the greater the challenge house-training is. Here are the keys to success when housetraining your dog:</p>

        <h4>1. Consistency</h4>
        <p class="para">Feed your dog at the same time every day. Developing a consistent feeding
          schedule makes it easier to predict when your dog will need to relieve themselves. Puppies usually need to go within 20-30 minutes after eating, so be ready to take them outside during this time.
          Use the same door to take them outside every time. Eventually, your dog may go to
          that door and sniff, whine or paw at the door to tell you they need to go outside.
          Take your dog outside to the same spot every time. Choose an encouraging phrase,
          like “go potty” or “it’s potty time”, and say it each time they’re in this spot.
          They will eventually associate this phrase with the act of relieving themselves.
          If your dog does go, give them lots of praise, and then bring them back inside. If they don’t go after 2-3 minutes, bring them inside and try again within an hour, watching for signs that they need to go.
          Dogs consistently need to relieve themselves after certain activities throughout
          the day: when they wake up in the morning, after naps, after playing, after meals, and after drinking water. Be sure to take them outside at each of these times and right before bedtime to prevent accidents.</p>
